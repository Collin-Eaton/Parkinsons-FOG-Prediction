# Parkinsons-FOG-Prediction
This project entails predicting Freezing of Gait in Parkinson's Subjects.  Freezing of Gait is where a subject attempts to move, is currently moving or stops moving and is delayed in doing so.  If the subject is walking, instead of a full on stride they will shuffle their feet.  If a subject is turning, they will shuffle to a full turn instead of directly turn.  Data was gathered on subjects in the lab and at home with an accelerometer or back sensor that detects how fast a subject is moving at any given period of time.  The subjects that have Parkinson's would perform one of three tasks to see if Freezing of Gait would occur. The tasks are starting to walk, walking, or turning.  The goal of this project is to classify a 1 or a 0 or anything in between for each of the three events to predict if any of these events triggered Freezing of Gait to occur.  The process for this project started with taking relational data tables with suject and test information, cleaning and joining the data into one dataset for model prediction, and identifying the best performing model for each of the three possible actions that could have caused freezing of gait.
